# P1_1 - Steganography

Stegonagraphy is the process of hiding information in nonsecret data/media. The information that you hide can be encrypted, but the main idea is to hide information in plain sight. One of the most common forms of media used in stegonagraphy to hide information is images. In this project, we hid information inisde of a bitmap image (.bmp)
